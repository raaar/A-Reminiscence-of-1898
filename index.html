		<h1 class="center title">A Reminiscence of 1898</h1>

		<h2 class="center">Wilfred Hugh Chesson</h2>

		<p>In 1894 I saw a manuscript by a very well-known woman author lying-a new and purchased commodity- upon the table of a famous publisher. The publisher was a liberal in politics and religion; his catalogue, impressively comprehensive, almost declared him to be the patron of Thought, pure, unspecified, unadjectived. The publisher turned over the preliminary pages of the manuscript and read these words:</p>

		<p class="center">To Oscar Wilde, with admiration.</p>

 		<p>'I'm not going to print that,' he said, and a faithful pencil chained to his person pounced upon the offending dedication and slew it.<br>
		That incident was the first which disturbed my view ofWilde as a young man's ideal, happy and secure in his free thought and originality. Hitherto he had been almost a humorous nursery figure, over whom Paterfamilias uttered a tolerant 'Pooh,' deeming his hedonism to be as rootless as most men's Christianity. Wilde had worn his hair long and curly, and his somewhat sudden sacrifice of its Postlethwaitian excess was audibly noticed, in his presence, by a girl to whom Wilde said, 'It was a pity, wasn't it?' This anecdote, a trifle insipid, is typical of those anecdotes from which the British public obtained an idea of Wilde, unjust to his power, but favourable to his liberty. Indeed,just after his death, a journalist employed the sieve, which I will designate his memory, to remember that the best of Wilde's wit was expressed when he said: 'I was disappointed by the Atlantic.'
		Even in my own home (which in I894 was No.5 in the street in which Wilde resided when he was not in London hotels or elsewhere) -even in that thoughtful dwelling Wilde was closely identified with the aesthetic bridegroom, whose intense bride adjured him to 'live up' to their six-mark teapot. He was an iconoclast who passed with the crowd as a comedian.<br>
		After 16 Tite Street, Chelsea, had been ransacked and despoiled to pay his creditors, a resident of 5 Tite Street, Chelsea, entered a bookshop in the adjacent Queen's Road. That resident was I. There I bought Wilde's beribboned Bible, some leaves of his MSS., the copy of Shakespeare's Sonnets which he had studied before writing 'Mr. W. H.,' a private copy of Duchess ofPadua and a corrected copy of Vera the Nihilist, a tragedy which he wrote when he was eighteen. The find was a happy one, enabling me to penetrate into his workshop. Among the pencilled marginalia of Vera I found this variant on an epigram attributed to Sir Robert Walpole: 'Every man has his price- but he was really quite expensive.' In The Duchess of Padua this witticism reappears in blank verse: 'Why every man among them has his price, although, to do them justice, some of them are quite expensive.'<br>
		In I898 I wrote to Wilde, offering him the plays as a gift. His reply<sup id="cite-1"><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup> reached me in Paris. It told me that his name was henceforth Sebastian Melmoth, and I saw that he had borrowed from a horrible romance which half Europe once admired, but which he was too modern to care much about. I mean Melmoth the Wanderer, by Charles Maturin, a connection of Wilde's family.<br>
		Wilde's Paris address was Hotel d 'Alsace, Rue des Beaux Arts, and there I delivered <i>The Duchess of Padua</i> and some leaves of his MSS.<sup id="cite-2"><a href="#note-2">2</a></sup> He was staying, however, at l'Idee, Perreaux, Nogent-sur-Marne, and thence he sent me an invitation to breakfast.<br>
		On july 5, I895- a perfect summer day- I saw for the first time, except in Punch, the tall and debonair poet and wit, who, in adversity, had entered my Pantheon. He awaited me at the gate of the courtyard of l'Idee- an unaffected Englishman, stalwart in homespun.<br>
		'1 am correcting the proofs of a play,' he said, The Importance of Being Earnest.'<sup id="cite-3"><a href="#note-3">3</a></sup> He gave good Irish weight, without roll, to the syllable 'port,' and I was amused, for I knew that he was throwing the play into the title.<br>
		We sat vis-a-vis at a round table in the courtyard, and I noticed the massiveness of his hair, and thought how different was its thick but not wavy abundance from the operatic idea of flowing locks. I hoped, as my eyes fell on his proofs, on a table near us, that he felt creative and eager for art. I named a man who borrowed his style in affecting to satirise it, and asked if such a person were not enough to irritate him into the mood for writing more novels and plays.<br>
		'It is dreadful, is it not?' he said, apropos the imitations of him thrown upon the market. 'Of course I can write, but I have lost the joy of writing'. I praised the future, and he said piously, 'I do not doubt that there are as wonderful things in my future as they are in my past.'<br>
		I told him my impression of <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i>. 'Ah! I had to write that,' he said, as if it came as naturally as the eloquent letter upon children in Reading Gaol, which appeared in The Daily Chronicle after his release.<sup id="cite-4"><a href="#note-4">4</a></sup> 'I am glad,' I said, 'that you allowed yourself a bad rhyme. "We banged the tins and bawled the hymns" is so perfectly out of tune.' He said he had thought of revising the line, but a friend had persuaded him to retain it. He thought the press had noticed the poem 'very sweetly,' and quoted a phrase by Mr. Arthur Symons- 'the unseen violence upon souls.'<sup id="cite-5"><a href="#note-5">5</a></sup> 'I should love to have written it,' he said. This unseen violence was the only personal suffering in prison which he spoke about.<br>
		'Once,' he said, 'while we were exercising, a man behind me said, "This is a strange place to meet Dorian Gray in!" "Not Dorian Gray," I said, "but Lord Henry Wotton."' Lord Henry, in The Picture rifDorian Gray, is Dorian's instructor in pleasure. 'This man,' added Wilde, 'had mastered, as we all had to, the art of talking without moving the lips. He said, 'I was at all your first nights, and I was at your trials.'<br>
		Wilde spoke with kindness of the associates ofC.3.3·, and here and there admired. 'Have you ever noticed a thief's hands?' he asked, 'how beautiful they are? How fine and delicate at the tips? They must be fine and delicate to take the watch from your pocket without your knowing.' His own hands were large and thick, and one of them was adorned by a scarab as big as sixpence. 'They say it is unlucky to wear it,' he said; 'but it is thousands of years old. I kept it when the rest went.'<br>
		He told me that, after his release (I8g7), he went to a palmist in Paris. She looked at his hands and said, 'I am puzzled. By your line of life you died two years ago. I cannot explain the fact except by supposing that since then you have been living on your line of imagination.'<br>
		Having some knowledge of the chiromantic art, I looked at his left hand. 'Here,' I said, indicating a horizontal under the little finger, 'is the line of your marriage.'<br>
		'That, too, was a fatality,' he murmured.<br>
		Of two prison governors with whom he had to do, he said that the former was not able to enjoy his breakfast unless some one was punished before he ate it; of the other he said, 'He was the most Christ-like man I ever met.'<br>
		Snatcher, a lively dog lent to him by Mr. Rowland Strong,<sup id="cite-6"><a href="#note-6">6</a></sup> was present and eagerly snapped up a morsel which Wilde rendered more appetising by christening it Dreyfus. He told me that he knew Esterhazy,<sup id="cite-7"><a href="#note-7">7</a></sup> and said that that remarkable man had said that at the age of thirteen he had a profound conviction that he would never be happy again as long as he lived. 'And it was quite true; he never was,' Wilde added.<br>
		We went for a long walk by the pleasant river Marne; and I was touched when the exile said, 'Might not his be a bit of the Thames?' Delightful residences rose on our right, and at a tall gate, which suggested rather than disclosed one of them, Wilde paused and said, 'That is what I like, just to stand and peep through the bars. It would be better than being in paradise to stand like this, catch a glimpse as now, and want to go in. The reality would sure to be disappointing.'<br>
		We talked literature, and he told me stories from Guy de Maupassant with enchanting energy. Thus it was that I heard of the two malcontents who, after all their grumbling, preferred to be shot rather than divulge the password to the besiegers of Paris. He said that he had been struck by the power ofa drama he had seen acted in a French theatre patronised both by criminals who wished to see an actor in a criminal role and men of letters interested in an artistic production. The point of the drama was the betrayal of a ferocious murderer by a timid light of love with whom he spent his last hours of freedom. There is a reward for his capture, and the girl is pressed by a hag to earn it. The murderer is taken in his sleep, and as, hopelessly overpowered, he is borne away, his hatred of his betrayer goes out in one venomous look. She sees it, and his impotence, the absolute certainty of his doom, are nothing to her. 'J'ai peur,j'ai peur!'<sup id="cite-8"><a href="#note-8">8</a></sup> she shrieks, and the curtain falls. Wilde delivered these words with a force that went into the marrow of my bones.<br>
		The subject of fear made him talk of the guillotine, which he had seen operate in the early morning. 'I have seen the victim look green with fright,' he said. 'They are kind to him up to the last minute. He may smoke a cigarette as he goes to the Place de Ia Roquette, but once there, what a change! They are on him like tigers, and his head is thrust into the groove under the knife as if he were not a man at all.'<br>
		He spoke of the Morgue. 'It is a dignified place. I cannot understand why people should object to go to it. There is nothing horrible in death. Death is solemn. Now waxworks are horrible, if you like. I remember,' he proceeded, 'going to the Morgue after seeing a brilliant function-all colour and music- at Notre Dame. A woman of the lowest class was on one of the slabs. She was having her day. All Paris might look at her gravely. She was no longer despised.'<br>
		He grew gay when, in addition to finding a franc for a cannette of beer, I found matches for our cigarettes. 'You are perfect,' he said. 'It was good when you produced money, and now you produce matches. What more can you ask of life?'<br>
		More, of course, could be asked, but my requisition waited while he told me of a silver matchbox he once had. It was stolen by a Neapolitan boy.<br>
		Taxed with the theft, the culprit confessed. 'You must give it up,' said Wilde. 'I cannot,' was the reply. 'It is too beautiful.' 'Come, come, where is it?' insisted the owner of the matchbox. 'I have hidden it,' said the boy. 'Every night I look at it before I sleep. I have never been so happy.' At last Wilde pleaded that the Matchbox was a souvenir from a dear friend. The boy was sceptical. There must be no fibbins. 'Are you sure?' Wilde was sure, upon his honour, and the boy's heart was moved.<br>
		We dined in the courtyard of l'Idee, and talked more literature. 'Do you know,' asked Wilde, 'who destroyed the MS. of Carlyle's <i>French Revolution</i>?' 'The servant of john Stuart Mill,' I replied, as informed by biographies. 'It was finer than that,' said he. It was Mrs. Mill. She read it and saw at once that if it was published, the first name in nineteenth century English literature could not be John Stuart Mill. It would be Carlyle. Think ofit. What servant could destroy the MS. of a whole volume in lighting a kitchen fire? She could only burn a few pages at a time, and be found out long before the end. No, it was Mrs. Mill. But her heroism was wasted. She had not reckoned on Carlyle's marvellous memory. How great he was! He made history a song for the first time in our language. He was our English Tacitus.'<br>
		He spoke with enthusiasm of Dickens. Micawber, Pecksniff, Mrs. Gamp, flitted before us. 'There have been no such grotesques since the Gothic gargoyles,' he said, and he quoted the passage in Martin Chuzzlewit which compares the rusty gowns and other garments hanging from Sarah Gamp's bed to 'guardian angels' watching her in her sleep.<br>
		He spoke with affectionate amusement ofMr.J. B. Yeats, Sr. 'Do you know how he became a painter? It was so simple and natural. He was a thriving barrister, when one day he came down to breakfast and said, "Children, I am tired of the law, and shall become a painter.'' They said, "Papa is going to be a painter,'' and were quite happy.'<br>
		'Could he paint?' I asked.<br>
		'Not in the least; that was the beauty of it,' said Wilde.<br>
		He could, however, as I discovered when I was in the dining-room of Mr. and Mrs. Hickson and saw his portrait of Katharine Tynan's father<br>
		Wilde expressed much amusement at Mr. W. M. Rossetti's family publications. He understood, I know not with what authority, that Christina Rossetti's washing book had been given to the public, and supposed that historical piety could go no further. He diverted me by a parody ofMr. Rossetti's account of his brother's misunderstanding with a bird. The poet, it appears, was much annoyed, and explained that a thrush was saying ill-natured things about him in the garden. 'But as far as I could gather,' Wilde represented Mr. Rossetti as remarking, 'the bird's observations had nothing to do with my brother.'<sup id="cite-9"><a href="#note-9">9</a></sup><br>
		'Tell me about ''Jameson's Ride,'" he said. 'I am told it was very funny,' and I quoted a line here and there from Mr. Austin's refreshing song. He begged for a copy of it, and it is on my conscience that I never sent him one.<br>
		By way of conversation 1 wondered how the laureateship was supportable in a sleet of ridicule. 'Vanity, my dear sir,' he replied. 'Vanity, the invulnerable breast-plate of man.'<br>
		'Why didn't they make Kipling the laureate?' he asked. 'It would have been such a change, so artistic. There was Tennyson, with his idyls, his well-bred and dainty muse, and here is Kipling, who makes his muse say, "Go to hell."' He commented sarcastically on Mr. Kipling's encyclopaedic method. 'I object to know all about cod fishing,' he remarked. He spoke with enthusiasm of some of Mr. Kipling's poetry, and quoted two well-known passages for the sake of their metaphor. 'An' the dawn comes up like thunder' was one of them. The other he gave as one who rejoices. 'He trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest.'<br>
		Swinburne he termed 'mere froth of the sea,' meaning high praise, perhaps. He said he was the first English poet to sing divinely the song of the flesh. We did not speak ofDonne, Carew, Herrick, who were so much more minute in their praise of women. He spoke with aversion ofMatthew Arnold's snippety sonnets: the adjective is mine. He said that he read through the whole of Dante's Divina Commedia in prison. 'You can imagine,' he said, 'how I tasted every word.' He recommended me to read it with Longfellow's rhymed translation, preferring it to Carey's dull blank verse. I mentioned Verhaaren, and he immediately said, 'Oh! now you mention the greatest living poet.'<br>
		He spoke of old friends- of Mr. Frank Harris,<sup id="cite-10"><a href="#note-10">10</a></sup> a man who does not think that a murmur of 'poor fellow' suffices to attest his sympathy for a friend in trouble; of 'dear Max,'<sup id="cite-11"><a href="#note-11">11</a></sup> whose caricature of him I cannot imagine. Of Sir Charles Dilke<sup id="cite-12"><a href="#note-12">12</a></sup> he said: 'I've only one fault to find with Dilke; he knows too much about everything.lt is hard to have a good story interrupted by a fact. I admit accuracy up to a certain point, but Dilke's accuracy is almost a vice.'<br>
		Of Henley,<sup id="cite-13"><a href="#note-13">13</a></sup> whom I found a sympathetic critic, he spoke more harshly than of any one except a prison governor. 'Have you noticed,' he observed, 'that ifa man has once been an editor he can always be an editor? The fact that a paper has a way of dying when he is on it is of the smallest importance. He is in demand before the corpse is buried. Here is Henley. He kills the Scots Observer. Hey presto! he is made editor of the New Review. Then the New Review dies.'<sup id="cite-14"><a href="#note-14">14</a></sup><br>
		He had not yet done with the author of London Voluntaries; his next remark was a voluntary of sensational vigour: 'The man,' he said, 'is simply eaten up with envy of any man whom he has not discovered. Fame exists on this condition: Henley must have made it.'<sup id="cite-15"><a href="#note-15">15</a></sup> For me, of whom Henley had written that he read me 'with unwonted interest,' this was simple Esperanto, and I was pleased when Wilde descanted upon envy as distinct from henvy. It is very wrong; it is unintellectual, he said.<br>
		The night was warm, and we stayed in the darkened courtyard. The eyes of Oscar Wilde grew very bright and he gazed with devotional rapture into his own day.<br>
		'My work was a joy to me' he said. 'I wrote Dorian Gray in three weeks. When my plays were on, I drew a hundred pounds a week! I delighted in every minute of the day.'<br>
		He told me to read In Mes Communions, by George Eekhond, a story of friendship ending in disaster worse than his, and he spoke that story to me in thrilling English, which returned to me when I read its French, and is in me yet.<br>
		The implacable Old Bailey rose before me as I looked at him, and again I waited for a verdict which would be upon Art as well as a man. I remembered a verdict which set Wilde free in an atmosphere of dread, and I remembered Lockwood's stentorian oration on a Saturday when I waited alone in a house of the street where he had lived. I remembered the brute force of judgment which banged the books of Scott and Dickens upon this man's writing. I remembered his infernal Sabbath after the second jury had spoken. I remembered a thriving comedy which Mr. Alexander had put on without its author's name, and I remembered, as one remembers rhetoric, that Lockwood was dead and that Mr. Alexander had known what it was to be criminally slandered and to encounter the professionally sceptical gaze of a magistrate.<br>
		I gave Wilde the gleams of my thought; he was indifferent. 'When I came out,' he said, 'my friends presented me with a box full of beautiful books- Keats, and so on. They are at Naples. There they lie.' He looked at me. 'You worry too much: never worry'; and he talked again like an habitue of Hatchard's. 'I do not approve of the shape of the Pseudonym Library,' he said. 'It is too narrow. It is unjust to a good style to print it on a tiny page. Imagine turning Pater over rapidly. It is violence.'<br>
		I reminded him of his relative, the Rev. E. J. Hardy, one of the Pseudonym publisher's great successes. 'Ah, yes, he has got on. I reviewed How to be Happy though Married for the Pall Mall, and I called it "The Murray of Matrimony and the Baedeker of Bliss."<sup id="cite-16"><a href="#note-16">16</a></sup> I used to say that I should have received a royalty for that phrase.'<br>
		I could not refrain from returning to his own work. While we were out I saw him as the big friend of a pretty French child, whom he had bought a toy for at a fair. I knew he was cut off from his own children. I knew that bright work could be a populous world for him in his lonely histrionic life. He told me in response that his work was in his head; he did not write it down. Then he related to me this parable:<br>
		'A man saw a being, which hid its face from him and he said, "I will compel it to show its face." It fled as he pursued, and he lost it, and his life went on. At last his pleasure drew him into a long room, where tables were spread for many, and in a mirror he saw the being whom he had pursued in youth. "This time you shall not escape me!" he cried, but the being did not try to escape, and hid its face no more. "Look!" it cried, "and now you will know that we cannot see each other again, for this is the face of your own soul, and it is horrible."'<br>
		The flash of rhetoric over, he grew sympathetic and looked at my fingers persuasively. 'You worry too much,' he said. 'Never worry.' I touched on religion, which I considered a killjoy and painmaker, as I do now. I recalled to him his remark to Wilberforce that the chief argument against Christianity is the style ofSt. Paul. 'I fear he tempted me,' he said. 'There is really something very artistic about Christianity,' he said. 'You go into Hyde Park, and a wonderful sentence comes to you on the wind. "What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul.'''<br>
		I spoke of life in spirit. He became indignant 'There is no hell but this,' he said; 'a body without a soul, or a soul without a body.'<br>
		It was about ten of the night when he went with me to the railway station. I said that his life was a harmony of two extremes, very rare and I thought very valuable. With a level suavity that, like the lawns ofOxford, had centuries of culture behind it, he replied, 'Yes, artistically it is perfect; socially most inconvenient.' We parted on a gay note. 'It does not matter what class you go up into Paris.'<br>

Wilde said in his review: 'It is a complete handbook to an earthly Paradise, and its author may be regarded as the Murray of matrimony and Baedeker of bliss.' The author of the book reviewed, Rev. Edward john Hardy, was an assistant master at Portora Royal School, where Wilde was educated from 1864-1871. He married Sir William Wilde's niece.
